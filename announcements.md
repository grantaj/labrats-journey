**Announcement 1:** "Passengers, our next stop is **Memory Lane Station**. Please keep a close watch on your belongings, especially those you've forgotten."

Whispers of the past,
Dancing on a gentle breeze,
Forgotten tales speak.

**Announcement 2:** "We're now approaching **Dreamscape Junction**. Here, the tracks are woven with hopes and the benches are made of fleeting moments. Mind the gap between reality and fantasy."

Hopes meld with skyline,
Fleeting moments shimmering,
Mirage on the tracks.

**Announcement 3:** "Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon be arriving at **Deja Vu Central**. You might feel like you've been here before, but can't quite remember when."

Air thick with perfume,
Strangers that seem so familiar,
Echoes of time sing.

**Announcement 4:** "Next stop: **Ephemeral Point**. Please note, the platform is only visible for a short while, much like moments that quickly pass us by. Hold on to them while you can."

Moments dissolve fast,
Like morning dew they vanish,
Urging souls to grasp.

**Announcement 5:** "We are now pulling into **Temporal Twist Terminal**. Time here is not linear. Hours feel like minutes, and seconds might last a lifetime."

Dance of hours, seconds,
Moments stretch and compress fast,
Time's waltz is timeless.

**Announcement 6:** "Prepare to disembark at **Liminality Landing**. This station is neither here nor there. You're in between destinations, and perhaps even between selves."

Twilight meets the dawn,
Suspended between two realms,
Shadows merge with light.

**Announcement 7:** "Last stop: **Journey's End Junction**. Remember, every ending is a new beginning. As we traverse life, it's not just the destinations but the space between them that shapes us. Reflect on the ride, and thank you for traveling with us."

Every ending's new,
Verse penned in life's poetry,
Tracks stretch on and on.
