**Announcement 0**
The next departure from platform square root of negative one is the six forty two Labyrinth Express service stopping at all stations to Worldsend. All passengers please take your seats and prepare for departure from reality. 

**Announcement 1:** "Shortly we will arrive at **Memory Lane**. Please keep a close eye on your belongings, especially those you've forgotten."

Whispers of the past,
Dancing on a gentle breeze,
Always out of reach.

**Announcement 2:** "We're now approaching **Dreamscape Junction**. Alight here for unconscious hopes and unresolved worries. Mind the gap between reality and fantasy."

Wavering skyline,
Fleeting moments shimmering,
A mirage ahead.

**Announcement 3:** "Ladies and gentlemen, we will soon be arriving at **Deja View**. You might feel like you've been here before, but can't quite remember when."

Air thick with perfume,
Strangers seem so familiar,
Reverberation.

**Announcement 4:** "Next stop: **Ephemerality**. Please note, the platform is only visible for a short while. Hold on to the handrail while you can."

Moments dissolving,
Vanishing like morning dew,
On a blade of grass.

**Announcement 5:** "in a few moments we will be making a short top at **Temporal Paradox**. Time here is not linear. Please be careful of meeting a past or future self. "

Relativity - 
With sufficient gravity, 
Time behaves strangely. 

**Announcement 6:** "For those wishing to continue travelling, please prepare to disembark at **Liminality Landing**. This station is neither here nor there. From here you may connect to any destination. "

Twilight meeting dawn,
Suspended between two realms,
Shadows merge with light.

**Announcement 7:** "Approaching **Worldsend**. This is the final stop, everything terminates here. All passengers please depart the train. Reflect on your journey, and thank you for traveling with us."

Constantly moving, 
Another destination - 
A new beginning.
